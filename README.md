# SleepEEGTools
Converts EEG capture data (either in raw or openvibe csv format) into spectrogram and allows self-analysis and marking of sleep stages.

## How to set this up
* Install Python 3 and pip3
* Install numpy, spectrum and matplotlib using pip3
* Run open.py, select your EEG capture file and the spectrogram will appear

## Windows setup
In order to install the dependencies using pip3 on Windows you need Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools. Get them from http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools and then use the "VS2015 x86 64 Cross Tools Command Prompt" to run pip3.
